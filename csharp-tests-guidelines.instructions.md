# Tests Guidelines

## What to test

1. Every method have to be covered by **Unit Tests**.
2. Every program entrypoint have to be covered by **Integration tests**.

## How to test

1. **Unit/Integration Tests** :

 - Unit/Integration Tests have to cover every possible path.
 - Unit/Integration Tests have to be independent one from another.
 - Unit/Integration Tests have to be deterministic (always give the same result for the same input).
 - Unit/Integration Tests have to have clear names (example : `MyTestedMethod((_As((RoleName))))_Should_DoWhatItIsSupposedToDoInThisCase_When_CaseTestCondition`).
 - Unit/Integration Tests have to test explicit datas to validate the test case specifically.
 - Unit/Integration Tests have to not use the real database.
 - Unit/Integration Tests have to generate dynamical fake datas which will not be afected by aleas like time, random, etc... .

2. *Unit tests** :

 - Unit tests have to test every possible combination.
 - Unit tests have to moq every dependencies.
 - Unit tests have to not use the real database.
 - Unit tests have to not fake a database exept for testing the database layer.
 - Unit tests have to cover every fonctions.
 - One test file = one tested function.
 - Unit tests files have to be named `MyTestedFuntion_Tests.cs`

3. **Integration tests** :

 - Integration tests have to test every program entrypoint.
 - Integration tests have to test every possible api endpoints
 - Integration tests have to test every possible batch arguments combination.
 - Integration tests have to test every possible error cases.
 - Integration tests have to test every possible input datas.
 - Integration tests have to test every possible path.
 - Integration test have to be as end to end as possible.
 - Integration tests have to cover 100% of the application.
 - Integration tests have to not use the real database.
 - Integration tests have to fake a database filled with fake datas.
 - Integration tests have to use WebApplicationFactory for testing apis.
 - One test file = one tested entrypoint.
 - Integration tests files have to be named `MyTestedController_MyTestedEndpoint_IntegrationTests.cs` (ex: `User_CreateUser_IntegrationTests.cs` for UserController's CreateUser endpoint).

## Test Structure

```csharp
[((Appropriate test annotation))]
public ((Appropriate method type : "void" OR "async Task" generaly)) MyTestedMethod_Should_DoWhatItIsSupposedToDo_When_CaseTestCondition()
{
    // Arrange
    -> INIT TEST DATAS IF NECESSARY
    -> INIT MOCK FOR UNIT TESTS IF NECESSARY
    
    // Act
    -> EXECUTE TESTED METHOD
    
    // Assert
    -> VERIFY THAT MYMETHOD DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO
}
```

## Librairies to use

 - Use [xUnit](https://xunit.net/) framework.
 - Use [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq4) for mocking.
 - Use [Bogus](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus) for generating fake data.

### Prefered when using librairies

1. xUnit

 - Use `[Fact]` for simple tests.
 - Use `[Theory]` for parameterized tests.

2. Moq

 - Use `Verify` for asserting mock interactions.

3. Bogus
 - When Creating fake datas,
   - Create a public static class named 'ModelFaker' in a helper file.
   - Create a public static method named 'ModelGenerator' in the 'ModelFaker' class that returns a `Faker<Model>` with all Model possible rules.
   - Never fix properties for test case in the ModelFaker class. Always override them in the Arrange part of the test (ex: for a boolean, use faker to generate a random boolean do not force the value to true or false).
   - Using faker, Always specify the lamba even when not usefull to avoid reusing the same object for all tests (ex:`RuleFor(model => model.BooleanProperty, f => true)` instead of `RuleFor(model => model.BooleanProperty, true)`).
     - Always name this lambda `f` for homogeneity.
   - if a model A wrap an other model B, use faker for model B in the rules of model A (ex: `RuleFor(modelA => modelA.modelB, f => ModelBFaker.ModelBGenerator().Generate())`).
 - When Generating fake datas,
   - Use `Faker.Generate()` to generate fake datas.
   - Use `Faker.Generate(x)` to generate x fake datas.
   - Use `Faker.RuleFor(modelName => modelName.propertyName, f => [override] )` to override rules during tests in "// Arrange" part.
