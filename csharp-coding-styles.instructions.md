# Coding style in C#

## Rules

1. Always take editorconfig over all rules.
2. Do not add comment to explain the code, code should be self explanatory with clear names and good structure.
3. Always prefer clarity/readibility in code.
4. Always use explicit names.
5. Always add summary documentation with parameter, return types and possible exceptions in interfaces.
